# Patient Care Template
App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

This Patient Care template is a fundamental building block for developers to create powerful apps with HIPAA compliant cloud support from Kinvey that let users regularly track care plans, monitor their progress, and share their insights with care teams. The template uses RadListView, RadDataForm and RadRadialGauge components that are part of [Progress NativeScript UI](https://github.com/telerik/nativescript-ui-feedback).

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-patient-care --template tns-template-patient-care-ng
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-patient-care-ng).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
tns create my-patient-care --template https://github.com/NativeScript/template-patient-care-ng
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!
